# Shell Script Generated Library

Uses the prometheus operator crds (the single bundle yaml in [a release](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/releases/tag/v0.86.0)).

The `justfile` script will `update` or `gen`erate hese types on request.

Renovate can be hooked up to the justfile to ensure the crds stay up to date with the operator.

## Minimal No Kube
Note this variant runs with `--hide-kube` for a case where the structs are used for their schemas (perhaps to generate helm values.schemas.json via schemars) so the root types (typically generated by kube) like `ServiceMonitor` are not available (only `ServiceMonitorSpec`)
